# FaceRecognitionCNN

<br>
<br>
The model in this design is the enhanced version of LeNet. Please use the algorithm as follows:  


- Download the dataset (lfw) we need and unzip it to directory 'img_source', and then run [set_other_faces.py]    
- Prepare a training video of user's face or just use camera to collect user's face data, run [get_my_faces.py]  
- Run [train_faces.py] to train the CNN model, some parameters can be adjust in this file(learning rate and batch size)  
- Run [is_my_faces] to verify the performance of the model
